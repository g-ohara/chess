# chess

This is an original chess engine that I built from scratch. Runs on the command line.

## How to compile
You can compile it by [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html).
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/g-ohara/chess.git
$ cd chess
$ make
```
Then you will get an executable file "chess" in your current directory.
